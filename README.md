# 52_card_sum_problem

- The 'cardSum.dat', '.mod', and '.run' are run in AMPL.  Only the .run file needs to be run.
  - These set of files find the combination of cards that add up to 52
  - Outputs the results as 'test.csv'
- The Jupyter notebook (Untitled.ipynb) contains the actual analysis that computes:
  - Checks if the sum of the set of cards equals 52
  - Checks if the solutions are unique
  - Number of combinations for each set of cards
  - Probabilities for each set of cards
- Jupyter notebook also outputs these computations into an output file ('solutions.csv')
